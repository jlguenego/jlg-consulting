Digital accessibility is not an option. It is a legal requirement, a lever for inclusion, and a marker of quality for your services.

## Understanding the Issues, Clarifying the Obligations

I help you clarify the standards (RGAA, WCAG), user expectations, and concrete ways to improve the accessibility of your websites and applications.

- Team awareness
- Assessment of the current situation
- Accessibility audit with structured report
- Assistance with compliance

## A Progressive and Constructive Approach

No dogmatism: every improvement counts. I adapt to your technical and human constraints to build a realistic, prioritized action plan that is monitored over time.

> "Thanks to Jean-Louis, we were able to make our intranet accessible without having to redo everything. He was able to reassure and support our teams." â€” _Claire, CIO in a large group_

## Deliverables to Take Action

- Clear and educational audit reports
- Concrete technical recommendations
- Assistance with writing the accessibility statement
- Coaching for developers and designers

## Towards a Culture of Inclusion

Accessibility is everyone's business. I also intervene upstream of projects to integrate these issues from the design stage and lay the foundations for a sustainable approach.
