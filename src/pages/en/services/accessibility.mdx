Digital accessibility is not an option. It's a legal requirement,
a lever for inclusion, and a marker of quality for your services.

## Understanding the issues, clarifying the obligations

I help you to see clearly in the standards (RGAA, WCAG), the expectations of
users and the concrete ways to improve the accessibility of your sites and
applications.

- Team awareness
- State of the existing
- Accessibility audit with structured report
- Assistance in compliance

## A progressive and constructive approach

No dogmatism: every improvement counts. I adapt to your technical and human constraints
to build a realistic, prioritized action plan
followed over time.

> "Thanks to Jean-Louis, we were able to make our intranet accessible without redoing everything
> He knew how to reassure and accompany our teams." â€” _Claire, DSI in a
> large group_

## Deliverables to take action

- Clear and educational audit reports
- Concrete technical recommendations
- Assistance in writing the accessibility statement
- Coaching of developers and designers

## Towards a culture of inclusion

Accessibility is everyone's business. I also intervene upstream of projects
to integrate these issues from the design stage, and lay the foundations for a
sustainable approach.
