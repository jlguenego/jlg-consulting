Architecture is the backbone of your information system. Well
thought out, it guarantees the robustness, security, maintainability and
scalability of your digital solutions.

## A pragmatic approach

I help you design or evolve your technical architecture by taking
into account your objectives, your teams and your operational constraints.

- Audit of existing architecture
- Design of software and cloud architectures
- Assistance in choosing technologies, frameworks, platforms
- Recommendations to improve performance, security or resilience

## Working hand in hand with your teams

I easily integrate into your teams to co-construct sustainable solutions,
without imposing a top-down vision. My approach is based on dialogue, 
transparency and adaptability.

> large group_

## Clear and reusable deliverables

- Detailed architecture diagrams
- Technical framing documents
- Migration or implementation guides
- Tool recommendations (CI/CD, observability, etc.)

## A guarantee of sustainability

My goal is not to complicate, but to clarify. I help you make
choices consistent with your internal capabilities, to build a
robust and scalable architecture, without unnecessary dependencies.
