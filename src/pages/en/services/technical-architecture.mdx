Architecture is the backbone of your information system. When well thought out, it ensures the robustness, security, maintainability, and scalability of your digital solutions.

## A Pragmatic Approach

I help you design or evolve your technical architecture while considering your objectives, your teams, and your operational constraints.

- Audit of existing architecture
- Design of software and cloud architectures
- Assistance in choosing technologies, frameworks, platforms
- Recommendations to improve performance, security, or resilience

## Working Hand in Hand with Your Teams

I easily integrate with your teams to co-build sustainable solutions, without imposing a top-down vision. My approach is based on dialogue, transparency, and adaptability.

> "Jean-Louis helped us revamp our architecture without disrupting our delivery pace. A true technical facilitator." â€” _Claire, CIO in a large group_

## Clear and Reusable Deliverables

- Detailed architecture diagrams
- Technical scoping documents
- Migration or implementation guides
- Tooling recommendations (CI/CD, observability, etc.)

## A Guarantee of Sustainability

My goal is not to complicate but to clarify. I help you make choices that are consistent with your internal capabilities, to build a robust and scalable architecture, without unnecessary dependencies.
