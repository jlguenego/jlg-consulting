Making the right digital decisions starts with a good understanding of
your issues. Whether you are a large company with complex objectives or
a community in search of efficiency, I help you see clearly.

## Customized support

Each structure is unique. My approach is to listen to you carefully,
to understand your context and your constraints, to offer you
concrete, realistic and adapted recommendations.

- Analysis of your business and technical needs
- Help in formalizing priorities
- Evaluation of existing or potential solutions
- Clear and argued recommendations

## Independent expertise

I do not sell turnkey solutions or products. My only goal is to
help you make the right choices, independently. I rely on more
than 20 years of experience in software architecture, development and
training.

## Actionable deliverables

The deliverables I give you are designed to be understood and used
immediately by your teams or your partners:

- Scoping notes
- Functional or technical mappings
- Roadmaps
- Decision aids

## Helping you move forward with peace of mind

Do you already have service providers or an internal IT department? Perfect. I can play
a role of trusted third party to consolidate exchanges and secure the
orientations. My goal: to save you time, avoid costly mistakes, and allow you to manage your projects with serenity.
