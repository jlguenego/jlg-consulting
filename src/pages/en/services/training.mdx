Training is about transmitting knowledge... but also reassuring, inspiring and encouraging
the desire to learn. I lead tailor-made training sessions, designed for your teams,
with a pedagogy adapted to their profiles and your context.

## Practical and concrete training

I favor learning by practice, exchanges, and feedback.
My training sessions are designed to be immediately useful:

- Introduction or improvement in web development
- Software architecture, DevOps, accessibility, performance
- Digital culture for non-technicians
- Artificial intelligence for developers

## A human and accessible pedagogy

I adapt to all levels, avoiding unnecessary jargon. The goal: that
everyone leaves with solid, applicable and understandable knowledge.

> all progressed with pleasure." â€” _Marc, HR manager in a SME_

## Customized content

Each training session is adapted to your challenges and your teams:

- Collection of needs upstream
- Customized content according to your tools and practices
- Exercises related to your specific cases
- Accessible and reusable course materials

## In person or remotely

I offer training sessions all over France, or remotely according to your
preferences. And I remain available after the session to answer questions
or assist with implementation.
