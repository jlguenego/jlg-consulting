Training is about sharing knowledge… but also reassuring, inspiring, and sparking the desire to learn. I conduct tailored training sessions designed for your teams, with a teaching approach adapted to their profiles and your context.

## Practical and Concrete Training

I prioritize learning through practice, exchanges, and feedback. My training sessions are designed to be immediately useful:

- Introduction or advanced training in web development
- Software architecture, DevOps, accessibility, performance
- Digital culture for non-technical individuals
- Artificial intelligence for developers

## A Human and Accessible Teaching Approach

I adapt to all levels, avoiding unnecessary jargon. The goal is for everyone to leave with solid, applicable, and understandable knowledge.

> "Jean-Louis made everyone feel at ease, even the less technical. We all progressed with pleasure." — _Marc, HR manager in a SME_

## Customized Content

Each training session is tailored to your challenges and your teams:

- Needs assessment in advance
- Customized content based on your tools and practices
- Exercises related to your real cases
- Accessible and reusable course materials

## In-Person or Remote

I offer training sessions throughout France, or remotely according to your preferences. And I remain available after the session to answer questions or assist with implementation.
