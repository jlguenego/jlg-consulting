Useful software is well-designed, well-developed… and well understood. I will assist you in creating or evolving your applications with rigor, pragmatism, and clarity.

## From Prototype to Production Software

I can intervene at different maturity levels of your project, either alone or in collaboration with your existing teams or service providers:

- Technical and functional design
- Development of web applications or internal tools
- Code review and continuous improvement
- Implementation of best practices (testing, CI/CD, documentation)

## A Craft Approach, but Not Improvised

I favor simple, documented choices that stand the test of time. Whether for a POC, an MVP, or a critical system, I emphasize readability, maintainability, and robustness.

> "Jean-Louis took over a complex project without documentation and got it back on track in a few weeks. He was able to engage our developers with pedagogy." — _Claire, CIO in a large group_

## Modern and Proven Technologies

- TypeScript, Node.js, Bun, Vue, React, Astro…
- REST or GraphQL APIs
- SQL/NoSQL databases
- DevOps tools tailored to your context

## Clean, Tested, and Documented Deliverables

Each delivery is structured to allow for resumption, understanding, and scalability:

- Clean and versioned source code
- Technical and functional documentation
- Reproducible environments
- Test plans and monitoring dashboards
