Good design is not just a matter of aesthetics. It's primarily a
clear, intuitive, and accessible interface that truly meets the needs of
your users.

## Designing with your users

I accompany you in creating useful, enjoyable, and
effective digital experiences. My approach is centered on real uses, not on trends.

- Co-design workshops with your teams
- Creation of wireframes and interactive prototypes
- User tests (or expert reviews)
- Consideration of accessibility issues

## Finding the right balance between form and function

Ergonomics, information hierarchy, micro-interactions: every
detail counts to guide the user and give them confidence. I help you build an interface that serves your goals without losing simplicity.

> "We needed to make our interface more understandable for everyone.
> Jean-Louis knew how to ask the right questions and propose
> elegant solutions." â€” _Marc, HR manager in a SME_

## Concrete deliverables for your teams

- UI mockups ready to integrate
- Modular design systems
- Clear specifications for developers

## Smooth collaboration with your service providers

Whether you already have a team or you are working with an agency, I can
intervene upstream or in reinforcement to frame, adjust or validate the
UX/UI choices.
