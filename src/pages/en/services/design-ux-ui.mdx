Good design is not just a matter of aesthetics. It is primarily a clear, intuitive, and accessible interface that truly meets the needs of your users.

## Designing with your users

I will help you create useful, enjoyable, and effective digital experiences. My approach is centered on real usage, not on trends.

- Co-design workshops with your teams
- Creation of wireframes and interactive prototypes
- User testing (or expert reviews)
- Consideration of accessibility issues

## Finding the right balance between form and function

Ergonomics, information hierarchy, micro-interactions: every detail matters to guide the user and instill confidence. I help you build an interface that serves your goals without sacrificing simplicity.

> "We needed to make our interface more understandable for everyone. Jean-Louis was able to ask the right questions and propose elegant solutions." â€” _Marc, HR manager in a SME_

## Concrete deliverables for your teams

- UI mockups ready for integration
- Modular design systems
- Clear specifications for developers

## Smooth collaboration with your service providers

Whether you already have a team or are working with an agency, I can step in early or as support to frame, adjust, or validate UX/UI choices.
