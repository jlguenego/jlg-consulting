| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `astro`                            | Static, lightweight, fast framework.                                                         |
| `@astrojs/react`                   | Integration of React components into Astro.                                                  |
| `react`, `react-dom`               | Dynamic components, used especially for interactive modules.                                 |
| `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite` | Utility CSS framework, used for modern, responsive, and customized styling.                 |
| `astro-icon`                       | Easy management of SVG icons.                                                                |
| `@astrojs/sitemap`                 | Automatic sitemap generation for SEO.                                                        |
| `openai`                           | Used to **automatically translate** pages from `/fr` to `/en` during the build.            |
| `sharp`                            | Image optimization (size, format) on the fly or at build time.                              |
| `ssh2-sftp-client`                 | Deployment via SFTP to OVH, with `deploy-sftp.js`.                                         |
| `dotenv`                           | Management of environment variables, especially for the OpenAI key.                         |
| `prettier` and its plugins         | Automatic code formatting (`.astro`, `tailwindcss`, etc.).                                   |

## 🌍 Internationalization

- The user writes the pages in French in `/fr`.
- An **automatic generation script** produces the equivalent pages in `/en`.
- **Translation is provided by the OpenAI API** at build time.
- The site structure is duplicated, allowing for simple routing between `/fr` and `/en`.

## 🎨 Design

- Minimalist, clear, and professional design.
- Use of **Tailwind CSS 4.x**.
- Main color: `green-700` from Tailwind, instead of blue.
- The site is **fully responsive**, with a mobile-first ergonomic design.
- The `.mdx` titles are centered and colored (`text-primary-700`).
- Lists have margins and a neat presentation.

## 🗂️ Content

- **Home**
- **Services** (via a centralized list `menuItems` shared between pages)
- **About / Bio**
- **Contact**
- **Legal Notices**
- Optimized images (WebP)
- SVG icons via `astro-icon`

## ⚙️ Internal Features

- **Reuse of React components** for future dynamic features.
- **Centralized variables** (`menuItems`) for easier maintenance.
- **Shared Tailwind configuration with `.mdx`.**
- **Intelligent build system for generating translated pages**.

## 🌐 SEO

- Appropriate `meta` tags per page.
- `hreflang` present for FR/EN alternation.
- Clean URLs (`/fr/prestations`, `/en/services`, etc.)
- Use of SVG icons and optimized images (Sharp + WebP)

## 🚀 Performance

- Static site: fast loading, excellent Lighthouse score.
- **No unnecessary JavaScript**.
- **Use of Astro Islands**: only the dynamic React parts are hydrated.
- Tailwind + CSS purge: ultra-light stylesheets.
- Images optimized with Sharp.

## ♿ Accessibility

- HTML semantics respected (`main`, `nav`, `header`, `footer`, etc.).
- Colors compliant with WCAG AA contrast.
- Keyboard navigation ensured.
- Readable text, adaptable font sizes.

## 🔐 Security

- No personal data collected on the client side.
- No form submissions.

## 📦 Deployment

- **GitHub Pages** via **GitHub Actions**.

- Maintenance of the current OVH structure: site + hidden FTP folders.
- Manual or automated deployment possible.
