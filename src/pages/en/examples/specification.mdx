## 🌍 Internationalization

- The user writes the pages in French in `/fr`.
- An **automatic generation script** produces the equivalent pages in `/en`.
- **Translation is provided by the OpenAI API** at build time.
- The site structure is duplicated, allowing for simple routing between `/fr` and `/en`.

## 🎨 Design

- Minimalist, clear and professional design.
- Use of **Tailwind CSS 4.x**.
- Main color: `green-700` from Tailwind, instead of blue.
- The site is **fully responsive**, with a mobile-first ergonomics.
- The `.mdx` titles are centered and colored (`text-green-700`).
- Lists have margins and a neat presentation.

## 🗂️ Contents

- **Home**
- **Services** (via a centralized `menuItems` list shared between pages)
- **About / Bio**
- **Contact**
- **Legal Notice**
- Optimized images (WebP)
