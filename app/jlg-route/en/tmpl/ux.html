			<h2>Prototyping</h2>
			<img class="center" src="../../../img/prototyping.jpg" alt="Prototyping">
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>From a really identified user objective, (re)design a portal user interface and a set of applications screen suite.</p>
			<h3>Purpose of the mission</h3>
			<p>Deliver to the development team the right mockup of an application, validated by the users.</p>

			<h3>How this is done?</h3>
			<p>You should know who your users are, what they want and propose a better way to do it than before. See the
				<a href="#user-modeling">User Modeling</a> mission to do it in a proper way.</p>

			<p>Identify if you need a portal, and then the list of the needed applications inside.</p>
			<p>Then you are ready for prototyping.</p>

			<p>Perform the following steps and <b>do not forget to have a user validation at each</b>:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Describe your nominal process, then decompose it to 5 majors steps max, that can be decomposed as well as 5 substeps
					max and recursively.
				</li>
				<li>Draw a storyboard in wireframe without computer tools (only pen and paper).
				</li>
				<li>Copy your wireframe storyboard with a prototyping tool (ex: Axure, etc.).
				</li>
				<li>With a graphical designer, insert the graphical elements (charts, etc.).
				</li>
				<li>Then give the mockup to developer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<b>Important note: </b>Do not explain how your interface work to the user, or the test is simply not valid.</p>
			<p>During a user validation, you may ask ONLY two things :</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What does he understand?</li>
				<li>Where does he want to click?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>No help is permitted.</b> If the user does not understand either does not know where to click to achieve his objective,
				then the test fails: it is a usability bug that needs to be fixed.</p>

			<p>The added value of doing this mission with JLG Consulting is to learn how to setup it in your organization and becoming
				autonomous. </p>

			<h3>Cost</h3>
			<p>Starting at
				<b>4000 euros HT</b> per nominal process according your needs.</p>
