		<h2 id="usability-test">Usability test</h2>
		<img class="center" src="../../../img/usability-test.jpg" alt="Usability test">
		
		<h3>What is it?</h3>
		<p>Observing a user having an objective and using your site to get it done.</p>
		<h3>Purpose of the mission</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Feed the backlog of usability requirements.</li>
			<li>Improve the usability level of your website.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How this is done?</h3>
		<p>Testing on the client site in front of all the stakeholders of the project. This mission absolutely requires the presence 
			of the technical and business decision makers of the projects or it will be less productive.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Recruit 2 users</li>
			<li>Deciding what tasks they are going to perform </li>
		</ul>
		<p>The meeting duration is 3 hours max:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2 hours observing users performing tasks</li>
			<li>1 hour for the debriefing with the project stakeholders</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The debriefing output is the backlog of usability requirement. This mission should be done on a regular basis. </p>

		<p>The added value of doing this mission with JLG Consulting is to learn how to setup it in your organization and becoming autonomous. </p>

		<h3>Cost</h3>

		<h2 id="interface-audit">Interface audit</h2>
		<img class="center" src="../../../img/interface-audit.jpg" alt="Interface audit">
		<h3>What is it?</h3>
		<p>Examination of all interface layout and widgets of an interface, and applying on them a robust check-list.</p>
		<h3>Purpose of the mission</h3>
		<p>Improving the user interface of an existing application or a mockup.</p>
		<h3>How this is done?</h3>
		<p>This is done by applying the Bastien-Scapin check-list, the gestalt law, and some of the Suzan Weinschenk things that every designer should know.
				
				
		</p>

		
		<p>If this mission is done by an experimented usability consultant, then better result it has.</p>
		
		<h3>Cost</h3>

		<h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2>
		<img class="center" src="../../../img/prototyping.jpg" alt="Prototyping">
		
		<h3>What is it?</h3>
		<p>From a really identified user objective, (re)design a portal user interface and a set of applications screen suite.</p>
		<h3>Purpose of the mission</h3>
		<p>Deliver to the development team the right mockup of an application, validated by the users.</p>
		
		<h3>How this is done?</h3>
		<p>You should know who your users are, what they 
			want and propose a better way to do it than before. See the <a href="#user-modeling">User Modeling</a> mission to do it in a proper way.</p>

		<p>Identify if you need a portal, and then the list of the needed applications inside.</p>
		<p>Then you are ready for prototyping.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Describe your nominal process, then decompose it to 5 majors steps max, 
				that can be decomposed as well as 5 substeps max and recursively. <br> 
				<b>Validate with users.</b></li>
			<li>Draw a storyboard in wireframe without computer tools (only pen and paper). <br> 
				<b>Validate with users.</b></li>
			<li>Copy your wireframe storyboard with a prototyping tool (ex: Axure, etc.). <br>
				<b>Validate with users.</b></li>
			<li>With a graphical designer, insert the graphical elements (charts, etc.). <br>
				<b>Validate with users.</b></li>
			<li>Then give the mockup to developer.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><b>Important note: </b>Do not explain how your interface work to the user, or the test is simply not valid.</p>
		<p>You may ask two things :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What does he understand?</li>
			<li>Where does he want to click?</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>No help is permitted.</b> If the user does not understand either does not know where to
			 click to achieve his objective, then the test fails: it is a usability bug that needs to be fixed.</p>

		<p>The added value of doing this mission with JLG Consulting is to learn how to setup it in your organization and becoming autonomous. </p>

		<h3>Cost</h3>
		<p>Starting at <b>4000 euros HT</b> per nominal processes regarding your needs.</p>
